hipsterTill
===========

![screenshot of page](/images/screenshot of app page.png)

We want to sell tills to local hipster coffee shop who are finally embracing the 21st century. We need a new till to replace their vintage machines - unfortunately, hipster staff are too cool to learn a new system, so we need you to build something that they will understand.

Specification
-------------

This is what a sample receipt looks like:

![a receipt](/images/receipt.jpg)

*Version 1*

To implement a system that contains the business logic to produce receipts similar to this.

Your receipt must calculate and show the correct amount of tax (in this shop's case, 8.64%), as well as correct line totals and total amount. Do not worry about calculating discounts or change yet. Consider what output formats may be suitable.

*Version 2*

- Add functionality to take payment and calculate correct change.  
- Add functionality to handle the following discounts:
	- a 5% discount on orders over $50
	- a 10% muffin discount

*Version 3*

Implement an user interface that can actually be used as a till.

Tech Used

Written in Javascript and AngularJS, and tested in Jasmine and Protractor.

Running the App Locally
-----------------------

Navigate to any folder and in the command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashleigh090990/hipster-till

$ cd hipster-till

$ npm install

$ bower install
```

You may have to install node and bower before installing the dependencies.

Update Selenium Webserver with the following command:
```
$ ./node_modules/webdriver-manager/bin/webdriver-manager update
```

Once it has been updated, run it with:

```
$ ./node_modules/webdriver-manager/bin/webdriver-manager start
```

While Selenium is running, open another tab in the same directory and run HTTP-Server:

```
$ ./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server ./
```

Then in Google Chrome, navigate to "http://localhost:8080/" and the application should load!





Running The Tests
-----------------

*Unit Tests*

To run the unit tests from the command line
```
$ ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start spec/jasmine-unit-tests/conf.js
```

*Feature Tests*

To run the feature tests, make sure that Selenium Webserver and HTTP-Server are running (detailed above) and in another terminal tab (also in the same directory) run:

```
"$ ./node_modules/protractor/bin/protractor spec/e2e/conf.js"
```
